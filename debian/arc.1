.SH NAME
arcanist \- command-line interface to Phabricator
.SH DESCRIPTION
NAME
.IP
arc \- arcanist, a code review and revision management utility
.PP
SYNOPSIS
.IP
arc command [options] [args]
This help file provides a detailed command reference.
.PP
COMMAND REFERENCE
.IP
alias
alias command
alias command target \fB\-\-\fR [options]
.IP
Supports: cli
Create an alias from command to target (optionally, with
options). For example:
.IP
arc alias fpatch patch \fB\-\-\fR \fB\-\-force\fR
.IP
\&...will create a new 'arc' command, 'arc fpatch', which invokes
\&'arc patch \fB\-\-force\fR ...' when run. NOTE: use "\-\-" before specifying
options!
.IP
If you start an alias with "!", the remainder of the alias will be
invoked as a shell command. For example, if you want to implement
\&'arc ls', you can do so like this:
.IP
arc alias ls '!ls'
.IP
You can now run "arc ls" and it will behave like "ls". Of course, this
example is silly and would make your life worse.
.IP
You can not overwrite builtins, including 'alias' itself. The builtin
will always execute, even if it was added after your alias.
.IP
To remove an alias, run:
.IP
arc alias fpatch
.IP
Without any arguments, 'arc alias' will list aliases.
.IP
amend [\-\-revision revision_id] [\-\-show]
.IP
Supports: git, hg
Amend the working copy, synchronizing the local commit message from
Differential.
.IP
Supported in Mercurial 2.2 and newer.
.HP
\fB\-\-revision\fR revision_id
.IP
Use the message from a specific revision. If you do not specify
a revision, arc will guess which revision is in the working
copy.
.HP
\fB\-\-show\fR
.IP
Show the amended commit message, without modifying the working
copy.
.IP
anoid
.IP
There's only one way to find out...
.IP
backout
.IP
Reverts/backouts on a previous commit. Supports: git, hg
.IP
Command is used like this: arc backout <commithash> | <diff revision>
Entering a differential revision will only work if there is only one commit
associated with the revision. This requires your working copy is up to date
and that the commit exists in the working copy.
.IP
bookmark [options]
bookmark name [start]
.IP
Supports: hg
Alias for arc feature.
.HP
\fB\-\-by\-status\fR
.IP
Sort branches by status instead of time.
.HP
\fB\-\-output\fR format
.IP
With 'json', show features in machine\-readable JSON format.
.HP
\fB\-\-view\-all\fR
.IP
Include closed and abandoned revisions.
.IP
branch [options]
branch name [start]
.IP
Supports: git
Alias for arc feature.
.HP
\fB\-\-by\-status\fR
.IP
Sort branches by status instead of time.
.HP
\fB\-\-output\fR format
.IP
With 'json', show features in machine\-readable JSON format.
.HP
\fB\-\-view\-all\fR
.IP
Include closed and abandoned revisions.
.IP
browse [options] path ...
browse [options] object ...
.IP
Supports: git, hg, svn
Open a file or object (like a task or revision) in your web browser.
.IP
\f(CW$ arc browse README   # Open a file in Diffusion.\fR
.br
\f(CW$ arc browse T123     # View a task.\fR
.br
\f(CW$ arc browse HEAD     # View a symbolic commit.\fR
.IP
Set the 'browser' value using 'arc set\-config' to select a browser. If
no browser is set, the command will try to guess which browser to use.
.HP
\fB\-\-branch\fR branch_name
.IP
Default branch name to view on server. Defaults to "master".
.HP
\fB\-\-force\fR
.IP
Open arguments as paths, even if they do not exist in the
working copy.
.IP
call\-conduit method
.IP
Supports: http, https
Allows you to make a raw Conduit method call:
.IP
\- Run this command from a working directory.
\- Call parameters are REQUIRED and read as a JSON blob from stdin.
\- Results are written to stdout as a JSON blob.
.IP
This workflow is primarily useful for writing scripts which integrate
with Phabricator. Examples:
.IP
\f(CW$ echo '{}' | arc call-conduit conduit.ping\fR
.br
\f(CW$ echo '{"phid":"PHID-FILE-xxxx"}' | arc call-conduit file.download\fR
.IP
close task_id [options]
.IP
Close a task or otherwise update its status.
.HP
\fB\-\-list\-statuses\fR
.IP
Show available status options and exit.
.HP
\fB\-\-message\fR comment, \fB\-m\fR comment
.IP
Provide a comment with your status change.
.HP
\fB\-\-status\fR status, \fB\-s\fR status
.IP
Specify a new status. Valid status options can be seen with the
`list\-statuses` argument.
.IP
close\-revision [options] revision
.IP
Supports: git, hg, svn
Close a revision which has been committed (svn) or pushed (git, hg).
You should not normally need to do this: arc commit (svn), arc amend
(git, hg), arc land (git, hg), or repository tracking on the master
remote repository should do it for you. However, if these mechanisms
have failed for some reason you can use this command to manually
change a revision status from "Accepted" to "Closed".
.HP
\fB\-\-finalize\fR
.IP
Close only if the repository is untracked and the revision is
accepted. Continue even if the close can't happen. This is a
soft version of '' used by other workflows.
.HP
\fB\-\-quiet\fR
.IP
Do not print a success message.
.IP
commit [\-\-revision revision_id] [\-\-show]
.IP
Supports: svn
Commit a revision which has been accepted by a reviewer.
.HP
\fB\-\-revision\fR revision_id
.IP
Commit a specific revision. If you do not specify a revision,
arc will look for committable revisions.
.HP
\fB\-\-show\fR
.IP
Show the command which would be issued, but do not actually
commit anything.
.IP
cover [\-\-rev revision] [path ...]
.IP
Supports: svn, git, hg
Cover your... professional reputation. Show blame for the lines you
changed in your working copy (svn) or since some commit (hg, git).
This will take a minute because blame takes a minute, especially under
SVN.
.HP
\fB\-\-rev\fR revision
.IP
Supports: git, hg
Cover changes since a specific revision.
.IP
diff [paths] (svn)
diff [commit] (git, hg)
.IP
Supports: git, svn, hg
Generate a Differential diff or revision from local changes.
.IP
Under git and mercurial, you can specify a commit (like HEAD^^^
or master) and Differential will generate a diff against the
merge base of that commit and your current working directory parent.
.IP
Under svn, you can choose to include only some of the modified files
in the working copy in the diff by specifying their paths. If you
omit paths, all changes are included in the diff.
.HP
\fB\-\-add\-all\fR, \fB\-a\fR
.IP
Automatically add all unstaged and uncommitted files to the
commit.
.HP
\fB\-\-advice\fR

.IP
Provide a prepared in advance excuse for any lints/tests shall
they fail.
.HP
\fB\-\-head\fR commit
.IP
Supports: git
Specify the end of the commit range. This disables many
Arcanist/Phabricator features which depend on having access to
the working copy.
.HP
\fB\-\-ignore\-unsound\-tests\fR
.IP
Ignore unsound test failures without prompting.
.HP
\fB\-\-json\fR
.IP
Emit machine\-readable JSON. EXPERIMENTAL! Probably does not
work!
.HP
\fB\-\-less\-context\fR
.IP
Normally, files are diffed with full context: the entire file
is sent to Differential so reviewers can 'show more' and see
it. If you are making changes to very large files with tens of
thousands of lines, this may not work well. With this flag, a
diff will be created that has only a few lines of context.
.HP
\fB\-\-lintall\fR
.IP
Raise all lint warnings, not just those on lines you changed.
.HP
\fB\-\-message\fR message, \fB\-m\fR message

.HP
\fB\-\-plan\-changes\fR
.IP
Create or update a revision without requesting a code review.
.HP
\fB\-\-preview\fR
.IP
Instead of creating or updating a revision, only create a diff,
which you may later attach to a revision. This still runs lint
unit tests. See also \fB\-\-only\fR.
.HP
\fB\-\-raw\fR
.IP
Read diff from stdin, not from the working copy. This disables
many Arcanist/Phabricator features which depend on having
access to the working copy.
.HP
\fB\-\-raw\-command\fR command

.HP
\fB\-\-verbatim\fR
.IP
Supports: hg, git
When creating a revision, try to use the working copy commit
message verbatim, without prompting to edit it. When updating a
revision, update some fields from the local commit message.
.IP
download file [\-\-as name] [\-\-show]
.IP
Supports: filesystems
Download a file to local disk, e.g.:
.IP
\f(CW$ arc download F33              # Download file 'F33'\fR
.HP
\fB\-\-as\fR name
.IP
Save the file with a specific name rather than the default.
.HP
\fB\-\-show\fR
.IP

export \fB\-\-diff\fR diff_id format
.IP
Supports: svn, git, hg
Export the local changeset (or a Differential changeset) to a file,
in some format: git diff (\fB\-\-git\fR), unified diff
(\fB\-\-unified\fR), or arc bundle (\fB\-\-arcbundle\fR path) format.
.HP

Instead of exporting changes from the working copy, export them
from a Differential diff.
.HP
\fB\-\-encoding\fR encoding
.IP
Attempt to convert non UTF\-8 patch into specified encoding.
.HP
\fB\-\-git\fR
.IP
Export change as a git patch. This format is more complete than
unified, but less complete than arc bundles. These patches can
be applied with 'git apply' or 'arc patch'.
.HP
\fB\-\-revision\fR revision_id
.IP
Instead of exporting changes from the working copy, export them
from a Differential revision.
.HP
\fB\-\-unified\fR
.IP
Export change as a unified patch. This format is less complete
than git patches or arc bundles. These patches can be applied
with 'patch' or 'arc patch'.
.IP
feature [options]
feature name [start]
.IP
Supports: git, hg
A wrapper on 'git branch' or 'hg bookmark'.
.IP
Without name, it lists the available branches and their revision
status.
.IP
With name, it creates or checks out a branch. If the branch
name doesn't exist and is in format D123 then the branch of
revision D123 is checked out. Use start to specify where the new
branch will start. Use 'arc.feature.start.default' to set the default
feature start location.
.HP
\fB\-\-by\-status\fR
.IP
Sort branches by status instead of time.
.HP
\fB\-\-output\fR format
.IP
With 'json', show features in machine\-readable JSON format.

.IP
Include closed and abandoned revisions.
.IP
flag [object ...]
flag object \fB\-\-clear\fR
flag object [\-\-edit] [\-\-color color] [\-\-note note]
.IP
In the first form, list objects you've flagged. You can provide the
names of one or more objects (Maniphest tasks T#, Differential
revisions D#, Diffusion references rXXX???, or PHIDs PHID\-XXX\-???)
to print only flags for those objects.
.IP
In the second form, clear an existing flag on one object.
.IP
In the third form, create or update a flag on one object. Color
defaults to blue and note to empty, but if you omit both you must
pass \fB\-\-edit\fR.
.HP
\fB\-\-clear\fR
.IP
Delete the flag on an object.
.HP
\fB\-\-color\fR color
.IP
Set the color of a flag.
.HP
\fB\-\-edit\fR
.IP
Edit the flag on an object.
.HP
\fB\-\-note\fR note
.IP
Set the note on a flag.
.IP
get\-config [options] \fB\-\-\fR [name ...]
.IP
Supports: cli
Reads an arc configuration option. With no argument, reads all
options.
.IP
With \fB\-\-verbose\fR, shows detailed information about one or more
options.
.HP
\fB\-\-verbose\fR
.IP
Show detailed information about options.
.IP
help [command]
help \fB\-\-full\fR
.IP
Supports: english
Shows this help. With command, shows help about a specific
command.
.HP
\fB\-\-full\fR
.IP
Print detailed information about each command.
.IP
install\-certificate [uri]
.IP
Supports: http, https
Installs Conduit credentials into your ~/.arcrc for the given install
of Phabricator. You need to do this before you can use 'arc', as it
enables 'arc' to link your command\-line activity with your account on
the web. Run this command from within a project directory to install
that project's certificate, or specify an explicit URI (like
"https://phabricator.example.com/").
.IP
land [options] [ref]
.IP
Supports: git, hg
.IP
Publish an accepted revision after review. This command is the last
step in the standard Differential pre\-publish code review workflow.
.IP
This command merges and pushes changes associated with an accepted
revision that are currently sitting in ref, which is usually the
name of a local branch. Without ref, the current working copy
state will be used.
.IP
Under Git: branches, tags, and arbitrary commits (detached HEADs)
may be landed.
.IP
Under Mercurial: branches and bookmarks may be landed, but only
onto a target of the same type. See T3855.
.IP
The workflow selects a target branch to land onto and a remote where
the change will be pushed to.
.IP
A target branch is selected by examining these sources in order:
.IP
\- the \fB\-\-onto\fR flag;
\- the upstream of the current branch, recursively (Git only);
\- the arc.land.onto.default configuration setting;
\- or by falling back to a standard default:
.IP
\- "master" in Git;
\- "default" in Mercurial.
.IP
A remote is selected by examining these sources in order:
.IP
\- the \fB\-\-remote\fR flag;
\- the upstream of the current branch, recursively (Git only);
\- or by falling back to a standard default:
.IP
\- "origin" in Git;
\- the default remote in Mercurial.
.IP
After selecting a target branch and a remote, the commits which will
be landed are printed.
.IP
With \fB\-\-preview\fR, execution stops here, before the change is
merged.
.IP
The change is merged with the changes in the target branch,
following these rules:
.IP
In repositories with mutable history or with \fB\-\-squash\fR, this will
perform a squash merge (the entire branch will be represented as one
commit after the merge).
.IP
In repositories with immutable history or with \fB\-\-merge\fR, this will
perform a strict merge (a merge commit will always be created, and
local commits will be preserved).
.IP
The resulting commit will be given an up\-to\-date commit message
describing the final state of the revision in Differential.
.IP
In Git, the merge occurs in a detached HEAD. The local branch
reference (if one exists) is not updated yet.
.IP
With \fB\-\-hold\fR, execution stops here, before the change is pushed.
.IP
The change is pushed into the remote.
.IP
Consulting mystical sources of power, the workflow makes a guess
about what state you wanted to end up in after the process finishes
and the working copy is put into that state.
.IP
The branch which was landed is deleted, unless the \fB\-\-keep\-branch\fR
flag was passed or the landing branch is the same as the target
branch.
.HP
\fB\-\-delete\-remote\fR
.IP
Supports: hg
Delete the feature branch in the remote after landing it.
.HP
\fB\-\-hold\fR
.IP
Prepare the change to be pushed, but do not actually push it.
.HP
\fB\-\-keep\-branch\fR
.IP
Keep the feature branch after pushing changes to the remote (by
default, it is deleted).
.HP
\fB\-\-merge\fR
.IP
Supports: git
Perform a \fB\-\-no\-ff\fR merge, not a \fB\-\-squash\fR merge. If the project
is marked as having an immutable history, this is the default
behavior.
.HP
\fB\-\-onto\fR master
.IP
Land feature branch onto a branch other than the default
('master' in git, 'default' in hg). You can change the default
by setting 'arc.land.onto.default' with `arc set\-config` or for
the entire project in .arcconfig.
.HP
\fB\-\-preview\fR
.IP
Prints the commits that would be landed. Does not actually
modify or land the commits.
.HP
\fB\-\-remote\fR origin
.IP
Push to a remote other than the default ('origin' in git).
.HP
\fB\-\-revision\fR id
.IP
Use the message from a specific revision, rather than inferring
the revision based on branch content.
.HP
\fB\-\-squash\fR
.IP
Perform a \fB\-\-squash\fR merge, not a \fB\-\-no\-ff\fR merge. If the project
is marked as having a mutable history, this is the default
behavior.
.IP
liberate [path]
.IP
Supports: libphutil
Create or update a libphutil library, generating required metadata
files like init.php.
.HP
\fB\-\-all\fR
.IP
Drop the module cache before liberating. This will completely
reanalyze the entire library. Thorough, but slow!
.HP
\fB\-\-force\-update\fR
.IP
Force the library map to be updated, even in the presence of
lint errors.
.HP
\fB\-\-library\-name\fR name
.IP
Use a flag for library name rather than awaiting user input.
.IP
lint [options] [paths]
lint [options] \fB\-\-rev\fR [rev]
.IP
Supports: git, svn, hg
Run static analysis on changes to check for mistakes. If no files
are specified, lint will be run on all files which have been modified.
.HP
\fB\-\-amend\-all\fR
.IP
When linting git repositories, amend HEAD with all patches
suggested by lint without prompting.
.HP
\fB\-\-amend\-autofixes\fR
.IP
When linting git repositories, amend HEAD with autofix patches
suggested by lint without prompting.
.HP
\fB\-\-apply\-patches\fR
.IP
Apply patches suggested by lint to the working copy without
prompting.
.HP
\fB\-\-cache\fR bool
.IP
0 to disable cache, 1 to enable. The default value is
determined by 'arc.lint.cache' in configuration, which defaults
to off. See notes in 'arc.lint.cache'.
.HP
\fB\-\-engine\fR classname
.IP
Override configured lint engine for this project.
.HP
\fB\-\-everything\fR
.IP
Lint all files in the project.
.HP
\fB\-\-lintall\fR
.IP

paths are specified, this is the default behavior.
.HP
\fB\-\-never\-apply\-patches\fR
.IP
Never apply patches suggested by lint.
.HP
\fB\-\-only\-changed\fR
.IP
Show lint warnings just on changed lines. When no paths are
specified, this is the default. This differs from only\-new in
cases where line modifications introduce lint on other
unmodified lines.
.HP
\fB\-\-only\-new\fR bool
.IP
Supports: git, hg
Display only messages not present in the original code.
.HP
\fB\-\-outfile\fR path
.IP
Output the linter results to a file. Defaults to stdout.
.HP
\fB\-\-output\fR format
.IP
With 'summary', show lint warnings in a more compact format.
With 'json', show lint warnings in machine\-readable JSON
format. With 'none', show no lint warnings. With 'compiler',

.IP
Supports: git, svn, hg
Apply the changes in a Differential revision, patchfile, or arc
bundle to the working copy.
.HP
\fB\-\-arcbundle\fR bundlefile
.IP
Apply changes from an arc bundle generated with 'arc export'.
.HP
\fB\-\-diff\fR diff_id
.IP
Apply changes from a Differential diff. Normally you want to
use \fB\-\-revision\fR to get the most recent changes, but you can
specifically apply an out\-of\-date diff or a diff which was
never attached to a revision by using this flag.
.HP
\fB\-\-encoding\fR encoding
.IP
Attempt to convert non UTF\-8 patch into specified encoding.
.HP
\fB\-\-force\fR
.IP

Normally, a new branch (git) or bookmark (hg) is created and
then the patch is applied and committed in the new
branch/bookmark. This flag cherry\-picks the resultant commit
onto the original branch and deletes the temporary branch.
.HP
\fB\-\-nocommit\fR
.IP
Supports: git, hg
Normally under git/hg, if the patch is successful, the changes
are committed to the working copy. This flag prevents the
commit.
.HP
\fB\-\-patch\fR patchfile
.IP
Apply changes from a git patchfile or unified patchfile.
.HP
\fB\-\-revision\fR revision_id
.IP
Apply changes from a Differential revision, using the most
