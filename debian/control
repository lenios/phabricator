Description: collection of PHP utility classes
 libphutil (pronounced as "lib-futile", like the English word futile)
 is a collection of PHP utility classes and functions which provide powerful
 extensions to the standard library.
 .
 libphutil is principally the shared library for Arcanist and Phabricator
 (see http://www.phabricator.org/), but is suitable for inclusion in other
 projects. In particular, some of the classes provided in this library vastly
 improve the state of common operations in PHP, like executing system commands.
