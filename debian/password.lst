#Debian does not allow us to ship the list compiled by openwall, so this is an
#empty file, just to be sure phabricator doesn't crash on us waiting for it.
#The openwall list is 3500+ passwords long, but only 634 are 8+ chars long
#(minimum password length with phabricator default settings) and only one
#(winniethepooh) is 12+ chars long.
