License: OFL-1.1
 PREAMBLE
 .
 The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide development of 
 collaborative font projects, to support the font creation efforts of academic and 
 linguistic communities, and to provide a free and open framework in which fonts may 
 be shared and improved in partnership with others.
 .
 The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and redistributed 
 freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The fonts, including any 
 derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, redistributed and/or sold with any 
 software provided that any reserved names are not used by derivative works. The 
 fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under any other type of license. 
 The requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply to any 
 document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
 .
 DEFINITIONS
 .
 "Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright Holder(s) 
 under this license and clearly marked as such. This may include source files, build 
 scripts and documentation.
 .
 "Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the copyright 
 statement(s).
 .
 "Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as 
 distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).
 .
 "Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting, or 
 substituting ‚Äî in part or in whole ‚Äî any of the components of the Original 
 Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a new environment.
 .
 "Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical writer or other 
 person who contributed to the Font Software.
 .
 PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
 .
 Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of 
 the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify, redistribute, and 
 sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font Software, subject to the following 
 conditions:
 .
 1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components, in Original or 
 Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.
 .
 2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled, 
 redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy contains the 
 above copyright notice and this license. These can be included either as

 machine-readable metadata fields within text or binary files as long as those 
 fields can be easily viewed by the user.
 .
 3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font Name(s) 
 unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding Copyright 
 Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as presented to the 
 users.
 .
 4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font Software 
 shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any Modified Version, except to 
 acknowledge the contribution(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or 
 with their explicit written permission.
 .
 5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole, must be 
 distributed entirely under this license, and must not be distributed under any 
 other license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not 
 apply to any document created using the Font Software.
